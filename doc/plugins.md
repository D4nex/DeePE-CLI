Series of plugins integrated into the project, plugins in development.

### Master
This is the master plugin, it is in charge of doing the analysis of the file using the native library of the project, all plugins must call the master plugin to work with the data resulting from the analysis, by default this plugin does:
- Generates a report with the data resulting from the analysis.
- Generates the dataset and integrates the data into the dataset if specified by the user.

### YaraRuler Plugin

Generate a YARA rule based on the possible IOCs in the program (must be for better accuracy e.g. inserting strings, or more data extracted).
